summary: 'You can use encryption to send secret messages, but if you want to be even
  more subtle, you can hide them in plain sight: in an image. This kind of encryption

  and only those who know will understand it. For maximum security, the message itself
  can be encrypted, as well.<br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org">https://hyperskill.org/projects/160</a>'
